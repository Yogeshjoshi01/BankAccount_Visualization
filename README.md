The sample data contains BankAccount Ids for which visualization is plotted. The current sample data contains three bankAccountIds. The details of all the files used are as follows:

1) startBalance.csv - This files contains starting balances for all the bankAccountIds. This can be thought of as a parent file from a bank's database

2) bankAcctsForViz.csv - AccountId for which visualization is to be created.

3) bankTransactions.csv - Transactional data i.e. all deposits and withdrawls for all bank accounts 

Objective - Create a line chart and corresponding bar charts for the bankAccountId in bankAcctsForViz.csv file for transactions greater than $200 between 03/01/2020 and 05/01/2020.
